# Gritty Survivor

>This is a web based game that attempts to recreate the popular game Vampire Survivors.
 
I wanted to try [KaboomJS](https://kaboomjs.com/) and thought it would be fun to recreate a game I enjoy playing. [Vampire Survivors](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1794680/Vampire_Survivors/) was initially made with [Phaser](https://phaser.io/), so I thought it would be a good challenge to recreate it with KaboomJS as it is a simpler library to use.

## Motivation

Since the core mechanics of the game are simple, I thought it would be a good project to learn the basics of KaboomJS. From this project, I learned how to create a game loop, add sprites, and handle user input with tracking the mouse position and collision detection.

**Core concepts used in this project are:**

- Collision detection
- Camera and layers
- Usage of scenes
- Dynamic stats
- Game states
- User input
- Game loop
- Sprites

## Demo

This is still a work in progress, but you can play the game [here](https://gritty-survivor.vercel.app/).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone git@github.com:JustGritt/Gritty-Survivor.git
```

1. Install the dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

1. Run the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

## How to play

1. Use direction keys to move the player and arrow keys to shoot bullets.
2. The player can level up by slaying monsters.
3. Survive as long as you can.

## Remaining features

There a lot of features that are still missing from the game. Some of the features that I plan to add are:

- [ ] Different types of monsters
- [ ] Different types of weapons or skills
- [ ] Temporary power-ups
- [ ] Different characters or classes
- [ ] Multiple patterns of monsters

And many more...
